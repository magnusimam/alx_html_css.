A responsive, clean landing page for a headphones brand. Built with HTML and CSS, drawn from the design in Figma. The layout shifts to a mobile-friendly view when the screen width is 480px or less.

## Design & Figma Reference

I used the design in Figma as my guide. You can view the original here:

[Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/DZeNiNLftvzHF6b8MR6qV2/a5366bbd595c643993665e2a28909370a7e12c66?node-id=0-1&t=zAxWm18wwewRQ3mG-1)

If your computer doesn't have the fonts used in the design (Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT), itâ€™s best to download and install them to match the visuals more closely.

Some measurements in Figma are floats; I rounded values for simpler CSS.
